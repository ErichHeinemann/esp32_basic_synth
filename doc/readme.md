On the back of most PCM5102 Boards I had seen 4 lead-plates H1L, H2L, H3L, H4L which provide an easy way to create a short or bridge from DEMP, FLT, FMT to Ground by connecting the middle plate to the right (GND) plate.
XMT is H3L and connects the middle Pin to the left (3.3 Volts).
That way, the only left pin to connect via a cable to ground is SCL.

Finally it looks more natural with the connections on the lead-plates compared to wires accross all pins.
